# Restock Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing product restocking at venues. The system allows users to create restock sessions, track inventory levels, and submit orders to an external ERP system (Unleashed). Built with React frontend and Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

**Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite for development and building
**Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
**UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
**State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
**Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Store user information (id, name, username)
- **Venues**: Store venue details (id, name, address, code)
- **Products**: Store product information (id, name, code, type, price)
- **Venue Products**: Junction table linking venues to products with par levels
- **Restock Sessions**: Track restocking visits with status, totals, and item data

### Backend Services
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation for development
- **Unleashed Service**: Integration with Unleashed ERP system for order management
- **REST API**: Express routes for CRUD operations on all entities

### Frontend Features
- **Multi-step Restock Form**: Progressive form for creating restock sessions
- **Quantity Input Components**: Custom components for managing product quantities
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation using Zod schemas
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users select their identity from a dropdown
2. **Venue Selection**: Users choose which venue they're restocking
3. **Product Inventory**: System displays venue products with par levels
4. **Quantity Entry**: Users input quantities needed for each product
5. **Session Creation**: Form data is validated and submitted to create restock session
6. **ERP Integration**: Orders are submitted to Unleashed system for fulfillment

## External Dependencies

- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with autoscaling:

**Development**: 
- Runs on port 5000 with hot module replacement
- Uses `npm run dev` command with tsx for TypeScript execution
- Vite dev server for frontend with HMR

**Production**:
- Build process: `npm run build` compiles both frontend and backend
